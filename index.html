      <p>We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Checkmate...

      Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. Must go faster. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?

      Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.

      So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

      You really think you can fly that thing? Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.</p>
